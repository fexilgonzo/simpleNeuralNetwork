# Simple Neural Network in PyTorch

This project is a simple neural network implementation built using PyTorch. It demonstrates the foundational steps in creating, training, and evaluating a neural network, making it an excellent starting point for beginners.

## Features
- **Core Concepts**: 
  - Defining a neural network architecture.
  - Training the model on sample data.
  - Evaluating model performance.
- **Beginner-Friendly**: 
  - Easy-to-read and well-documented code to aid learning.
  - Focused on illustrating the basics of neural networks.

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- PyTorch
- NumPy

## Installation
Install the required dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install torch numpy
```

## Running the Script
To run the script, navigate to the project directory and execute the following command in your terminal:
```bash
python simple_neural_network.py
```

## Structure
- **`simple_neural_network.py`**: Contains the implementation of the neural network.
- **README.md**: Documentation for the project.

## Next Steps
- Experiment by modifying the architecture or hyperparameters in the script.
- Add your own dataset to test the network's adaptability.
